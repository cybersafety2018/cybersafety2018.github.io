								The theme of cybersafety is an important emerging research topic on the Internet that manifests itself daily as users navigate the Web and networked applications. Examples of cybersafety issues include cyberbullying, cyberthreats, recruiting minors via Internet services for nefarious purposes, using deceptive means to dupe vulnerable populations, exhibiting misbehaving behaviors such as using profanity or flashing in online video chats, and many others. These issues have a direct negative impact on the social, psychological and in some cases physical well-being of the end users. An important characteristic of these issues is that they fall in a grey legal area, where perpetrators may claim freedom of speech or rights to free expression despite causing harm. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The goal of this inaugural workshop on cybersafety is to bring together the researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools and techniques. The focus of this workshop is on <i>computational methods</i> in cybersafety, including new algorithms, tools, data mining techniques and analysis, systems and applications for the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.  Social and psychological issues related to cybersafety, while important, are beyond the scope of this workshop and are better addressed in other venues.  The workshop will be comprised of keynote speeches, panel discussions, paper presentations and breakout sessions. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Cyberbullying in social media</li>
								<li>Cyberthreats, coercion, and undue social pressure</li>
								<li>Misbehaving users in online video chat services</li>
								<li>Trolls in chat rooms, discussion boards and other media</li>
								<li>The role of anonymity in cybersafety</li>
								<li>Irresponsible use of live-streaming video</li>
								<li>Deceptive techniques targeted at vulnerable populations such as the elderly and K-12 minors</li>
								<li>Bad actors in social media</li>
								<li>Online exposure of inappropriate material to minors</li>
								<li>Education and promoting safe practices</li>
								<li>Remedies for preventing or thwarting cybersafety issues</li>
							</ul>
