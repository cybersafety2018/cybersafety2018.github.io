								The theme of cybersafety is an important emerging research topic on the Internet that manifests itself daily as users navigate the Web and networked applications. After two successful workshops on cybersafety, the main goal of this third edition of this workshop on cybersafety is to build and grow the cybersafety research community by bringing together the leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the general area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools, and techniques. The focus is on the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.

								The goal of  workshop on cybersafety is to bring together the researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools and techniques. The focus of this workshop is on <i>computational methods</i> in cybersafety, including new algorithms, tools, data mining techniques and analysis, systems and applications for the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.  Social and psychological issues related to cybersafety, while important, are beyond the scope of this workshop and are better addressed in other venues.  The workshop will be comprised of keynote speeches, panel discussions, paper presentations and breakout sessions. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Cyberbullying in social media</li>
								<li>Misinformation and fake news in social media</li>
								<li>Online harrassments, cyberthreats, coercion, and undue social pressure</li>
