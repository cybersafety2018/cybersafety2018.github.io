							Title: Racial and Gender Differences in Cyberbullying Behavior
						</p>
						
						<p name="keynote_april_abstract" id="keynote_april_abstract">
							 Abstract: Researchers have previously explored cyberbullying from a variety of perspectives: the psychosocial characteristics of bullies and their victims, 
							 types of bullying acts, and psychological impacts. However, very few researchers have explored the role of bullies’ and victims’ race/ethnicity 
							 in relation to self-disclosures or cyberbullying experiences. In our prior work, we found that youths of color report lower levels of cyber-victimization
							 than their white peers; indeed, black and Hispanic youth are more likely to be cyber-bullies and offline bullies than victims of bullying. In this talk,
							 we use an online survey to explore the relationship between race/ethnicity, disclosure, cyberbullying and race and gender. We found that white youth disclose 
							 more information than non-whites, and there a significant relationship between disclosure and cyberbullying. Specifically, Black and Hispanic youths self-disclose 
							 less and are cyberbullied less than their White peers.
