					Title: Racial and Gender Differences in Cyberbullying Behavior
				</p>
				
				<p name="keynote_april_abstract" id="keynote_april_abstract">
					 Abstract: Researchers have previously explored cyberbullying from a variety of perspectives: the psychosocial characteristics of bullies and their victims, 
					 types of bullying acts, and psychological impacts. However, very few researchers have explored the role of bullies’ and victims’ race/ethnicity 
					 in relation to self-disclosures or cyberbullying experiences. In our prior work, we found that youths of color report lower levels of cyber-victimization
					 than their white peers; indeed, black and Hispanic youth are more likely to be cyber-bullies and offline bullies than victims of bullying. In this talk,
					 we use an online survey to explore the relationship between race/ethnicity, disclosure, cyberbullying and race and gender. We found that white youth disclose 
					 more information than non-whites, and there a significant relationship between disclosure and cyberbullying. Specifically, Black and Hispanic youths self-disclose 
					 less and are cyberbullied less than their White peers.

					Bio: April Edwards is the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty at Elmhurst College, in Elmhurst IL, USA.  
					Dr. Edwards is also a Professor of Computer Science and Information Systems, having received her PhD in textual data mining 
					from Lehigh University in 2003.  Dr. Edwards' primary research interest is textual data mining, with an emphasis on the detection 
					and prevention of cyberbullying and Internet sexual predation. She has over 43 peer reviewed publications and has received over $1.1 
					million in extramural funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her research.  A strong proponent of undergraduate 
					research experiences, she has mentored over 60 undergraduate students, many of them women and students of color, on research projects, 
					and was co-principal investigator on a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites award from the NSF.

					Title: Anomaly Detection on Large Social Graphs
				</p>
				
				<p name="keynote_neil_abstract" id="keynote_neil_abstract">
					 Abstract: Given the ever-growing prevalence of online social services, usefully leveraging massive datasets has become an increasingly important challenge 
					 for businesses and end-users alike. Online services capture a wealth of information about user behavior and platform interactions, such as who-follows-whom 
					 relationships in social networks and who-rates-what-and-when relationships in e-commerce networks. Since many of these services rely on data-driven algorithms 
					 to recommend relevant content to their users, authenticity of user behavior is paramount to success. But given anonymity on the internet, how do we know which 
					 users and actions are real and which are fake?  This talk expands on this problem and introduces new techniques to discern anomalous and fraudulent behavior in 
					 different types of online social graphs. Specifically, I discuss work on three thrusts: plain, dynamic and rich graphs, each of which corresponds to a different 
					 informational setting for anomaly detection.  I'll discuss one of my past works from each of these areas, covering a wide range of challenges including detecting 
					 suspicious link behavior in social graphs, leveraging temporal features to detect fake views on livestreaming platforms, and ranking node suspiciousness in edge-
					 attributed graphs based on their actions.  The techniques used in these works span various disciplines including data mining, machine learning, graph theory, 
					 information theory and social sciences and are practically applicable to a number of real-world fraud and anomaly detection scenarios. They are carefully designed 
					 and scale to massive datasets, including social networks, telecommunication networks, e-commerce and collaboration networks with millions of nodes and billions of edges.

					Bio:  Neil is currently a research scientist at Snap Inc. in Venice, CA, where he focuses on problems at the intersection of data mining and security.  His current research 
					interests include online abuse and misbehavior in large-scale social platforms.  He graduated in 2017 from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department, 
					advised by Prof. Christos Faloutsos.  He previously received his BS in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2013.  His work has resulted in 20+ top 
					conference and journal publications in venues such as KDD, ICDM, WWW, SDM, DSAA, PAKDD, TKDD and more.  He has previously interned at Lawrence Livermore
