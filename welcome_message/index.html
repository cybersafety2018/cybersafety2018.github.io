						<h3>Chairs' Welcome Message</h3>
						<p>The theme of cybersafety is an important emerging research topic on the Internet that manifests itself daily as users navigate the Web and networked applications. After two successful workshops on cybersafety, the main goal of this third edition of this workshop on cybersafety is to build and grow the cybersafety research community by bringing together the leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the general area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools, and techniques. The focus is on the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.</p>
