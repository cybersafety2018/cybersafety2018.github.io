						<h3>Chairs' Welcome Message</h3>
						<p>We welcome you to the First ACM International Workshop on Computational Methods for CyberSafety. The goal of this inaugural workshop on cybersafety is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the area of cybersafety. We broadly interpret cybersafety as covering those topics related to making the Internet safer for its users, especially characterizing, detecting and mitigating online misbehavior that is not necessarily illegal but is still damaging to the Internet's users. Examples of cybersafety topics include detection and mitigation of cyberbullying in social networks, bad actors in social media, vandals and hoaxes in the Internet, deceptive and/or abusive online advertising. The focus of this workshop is on computational methods in cybersafety, including new algorithms, tools, data mining techniques and analysis, systems and applications for the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.</p>
						
						<p>
						We are pleased to offer an exciting program that begins with a keynote address by Professor Francesca Spezzano of Boise State University on the cybersafety topic of "Bad Actors in Social Media". This is followed by invited talks by Srijan Kumar from the University of Maryland on "Vandals and Hoaxes on the
Web", by Dr. Jeremy Blackburn of Telefonica Research on "Informing Cyberbullying Research with Social/Psychological Insights", and by Dr. Homa Hosseinmardi of Danaher Labs on "Survey of Computational Methods in Cyberbullying Research". Next, two paper presentations will be given on "Catching Social Media Advertisers with Strategy Analysis" by Meng Jiang of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and "Detecting Cyberbullying using Latent Semantic Indexing" by Jacob L. Bigelow, April Edwards Kontostathis, and Lynne Edwards of Ursinus College. We conclude with an invited talk by Professor Bert Huang of Virginia Tech University on "A Weakly Supervised Approach for Adaptive Detection of Cyberbullying Roles", followed by a panel discussion.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						We invite you to join us at the workshop and look forward to the presentations, Q&A discussions, and
interaction with the workshop participants!
