						<h3>Call for Contributions</h3>
						<p>The goal of this inaugural workshop on cybersafety is to bring together the researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools and techniques. The focus of this workshop is on computational methods in cybersafety, including new algorithms, tools, data mining techniques and analysis, systems and applications for the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices. Social and psychological issues related to cybersafety, while important, are beyond the scope of this workshop and are better addressed in other venues. The workshop will be comprised of keynote speeches, panel discussions, paper presentations and breakout sessions.</p>
