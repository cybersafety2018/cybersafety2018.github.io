						<h3>Call for Contributions</h3>
						<p>Examples of cybersafety issues include cyberbullying, cyberthreats, fake news, recruiting
minors via Internet services for nefarious purposes, misinformation, online harassment, using deceptive means to dupe vulnerable
populations, exhibiting misbehaving behaviors such as using profanity or flashing in online video
chats, spreading rumors or making hate speeches via WWW services, and many others. These
issues have a direct negative impact on the social, psychological and in some cases physical
well-being of the end users. An important characteristic of these issues is that they fall in a grey
legal area, where perpetrators may claim freedom of speech or rights to free expression despite
causing harm. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Cyberbullying in social media</li>
								<li>Misinformation and fake news in social media</li>
								<li>Online harassment, cyberthreats, coercion, and undue social pressure</li>
								<li>Misbehaving users in online video chat services</li>
								<li>Trolls in chat rooms, discussion boards and other social media</li>
								<li>Deception to shape opinion, such as spinning</li>
								<li>Deceptive techniques targeted at vulnerable populations such as the elderly and K-12 minors</li>
								<li>Bad actors in social media</li>
								<li>Online exposure of inappropriate material to minors</li>
								<li>Education and promoting safe practices</li>
								<li>Remedies for preventing or thwarting cybersafety issues</li>
								<li>Hate speech and rumors in WWW services</li>
							</ul>
